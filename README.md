# Tonnis Game VR
Is an early stage development of a Badminton-Tennis game designed for VR platform.


# Features:
Bouncing ball mechanism is done without Physics (using transform)

The racket is adjusted to bounce the ball towards the opponent's court so that the ball's bounce is not too random

The field scale and net are set according to the actual size (in meters)

First-person movement


# Weaknesses:
Some parameters in the game such as gravity, hitting power, enemy speed, and other parameters have not been adjusted to make it more enjoyable to play

The scoring system is still half-baked

Still using simple graphics.
